# sturdy

Sturdy is a hackathon project which is developed by team of 3, Ozan Cinci, Kadircan Bozkurt and Enes Sezgin. We had 24 hours to come up with an idea and to make a demo.

Sturdy tries to construct more secure storage system which utilizes blockchain technologies. Main goal of the project is preventing leak of data without making user experience more complex and granting a user full control of his/her data access. Users can easily change visibility of their private data using UI.
