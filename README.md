# Sturdy

Sturdy is a hackathon project which is developed by team of 3, Ozan Cinci, Kadircan Bozkurt and Enes Sezgin. We had 24 hours to come up with an idea and to make a demo.

Sturdy tries to construct more secure storage system which utilizes blockchain technologies on Avalanche Network. Main goal of the project is preventing leak of data without making user experience more complex and granting a user full control of his/her data access. Users can easily change visibility of their private data using UI.

## Here is Demo of Study:
